    "# Maritime Graph Weighting and Pathfinding Pipeline\n\nThis notebook provides a comprehensive, end-to-end workflow for applying intelligent weighting to a maritime navigation graph and calculating optimal routes using file-based storage (GeoPackage or SpatiaLite).\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThis is **Step 3** in the four-step maritime routing pipeline:\n\n1. **Base Graph Creation** (`graph_PostGIS_v2.ipynb` or `graph_GeoPackage_v2.ipynb`): Creates coarse-resolution graph (0.3 NM spacing)\n2. **Fine/H3 Graph Creation** (`graph_fine_PostGIS_v2.ipynb` or `graph_fine_GeoPackage_v2.ipynb`): Creates high-resolution graph (0.02-0.3 NM or hexagonal)\n3. **Graph Weighting & Pathfinding** (THIS NOTEBOOK): Applies intelligent weights and calculates routes\n4. Configuration & Orchestration: Use workflow scripts for full automation\n\n## What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook implements a **three-tier weighting system** that combines:\n\n1. **Conversion**: Converting an undirected graph to a directed one to support traffic-flow constraints.\n2. **Enrichment**: Adding S-57 feature data (depth, clearance, orientation) to graph edges for smart routing.\n3. **Weighting**: Applying three tiers of weights:\n   - **Static weights**: Distance-based penalties/bonuses from navigational features (land, fairways, TSS lanes)\n   - **Directional weights**: Traffic flow alignment penalties/rewards (follow one-way lanes, align with fairways)\n   - **Dynamic weights**: Vessel-specific constraints (draft, height, environmental conditions)\n4. **Pathfinding**: Calculating optimal routes on the fully weighted graph using A* algorithm.\n\nThe entire pipeline is optimized for large graphs by performing all intensive operations directly within the file-based database (SpatiaLite). The graph is only loaded into memory at the final pathfinding step.\n\n## Key Features\n\n**File-Based Design**: All data is stored in portable GeoPackage/SpatiaLite files:\n- No database server required\n- Easy to share and archive\n- Works on any system with GDAL/GeoPandas installed\n- Perfect for offline or distributed use\n\n**Database-Side Operations**: All intensive computations happen within the file database:\n- Spatial joins with R-tree index optimization\n- Window functions for feature prioritization\n- Trigonometric calculations for bearing analysis\n- Zero Python memory usage during weight calculations\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis notebook requires:\n1. **Directed Graph** (or will create from undirected): Pre-computed fine/H3 graph from Step 2\n2. **ENC Data**: S-57 charts converted to GeoPackage/SpatiaLite format\n3. **Configuration Files**:\n   - `graph_config.yml`: Graph layer definitions and weight settings\n4. **Data Files**: GeoPackage files in the `output` directory\n\n**Setup Instructions:** See `docs/SETUP.md` for converting S-57 data to GeoPackage/SpatiaLite backend.\n\n**Troubleshooting:** See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues and solutions."

    "## 1. Notebook Configuration\n\nAdjust the parameters in this section to control the notebook's behavior. You can run the entire weighting pipeline or toggle individual steps to skip completed operations.\n\n### Key Configuration Notes:\n- **Graph Names**: Must match output from fine/H3 graph creation step (Step 2). Test names include `\"h3_graph_gpkg_6_11\"` for H3 graphs or `\"fine_graph_10\"` for fine grids\n- **Workflow Steps**: Set to `False` to skip already-completed operations (useful for re-running portions without reprocessing)\n- **Vessel Parameters**: Adjust draft/height to match your specific vessel (affects navigable areas and route costs):\n  - `draft`: Distance from waterline to bottom of vessel (determines minimum water depth)\n  - `height`: Distance from waterline to highest point (determines maximum bridge clearance)\n  - `safety_margin`: Extra clearance to add for safety (under-keel clearance buffer)\n- **Environmental Conditions**: Factors that increase routing penalties:\n  - `weather_factor`: 1.0 = good conditions, >1.0 = poor (e.g., storms increase costs)\n  - `visibility_factor`: 1.0 = good conditions, >1.0 = poor (reduces speed confidence)\n  - `time_of_day`: 'day' or 'night' (night navigation has higher penalties)\n- **Usage Bands**: Controls which ENC chart scales contribute to weights (Band 3-5 recommended):\n  - Band 3: Approach (1:90K scale) - Regional planning\n  - Band 4: Harbour Entrance (1:22K-45K) - Harbor entrance\n  - Band 5: Harbour (1:4K-12K) - Detailed harbor operations\n\nSee `graph_config.yml` for production-ready configuration with full parameter documentation."

    "## 3. Convert to Directed Graph\n\n**Why this step is needed:** The undirected fine/H3 graph treats edges bidirectionally. However, maritime traffic often has directional rules:\n- One-way traffic lanes (Traffic Separation Schemes)\n- Current/wind patterns that favor certain directions\n- Fairway orientation preferences\n\nConverting to a directed graph allows us to:\n1. Assign different weights to forward and reverse directions\n2. Model one-way traffic lanes and channels\n3. Apply directional bonuses/penalties based on traffic flow\n4. Prepare for sophisticated routing that considers real-world constraints\n\n**How it works:** Each undirected edge (A-B) becomes two directed edges (A\u2192B and B\u2192A). Feature data is propagated to both directions during enrichment. The operation is performed entirely on the file-based database side using SpatiaLite SQL for maximum performance.\n\n**Database Operation**: This conversion is performed entirely database-side using SQL, creating new edge and node layers in the GeoPackage file."

    "\n",
    "**Critical prerequisite for all weighting steps.** This process extracts navigational data from S-57 Electronic Navigational Charts and adds it to graph edges as feature attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Step Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial Joins**: Uses SpatiaLite R-tree indexes to efficiently join edges with nearby S-57 features\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Adds `ft_*` columns to the edge table for each relevant attribute:\n",
    "   - `ft_depth`: Water depth from soundings/depth areas (for draft clearance)\n",
    "   - `ft_orient`: Traffic flow orientation in degrees (for directional weights)\n",
    "   - `ft_trafic`: Traffic direction code (1=one-way, 2=two-way)\n",
    "   - `ft_verclr`: Vertical clearance from bridges/cables (for height checks)\n",
    "   - `ft_valsou`: Minimum sounding value (for shallow water detection)\n",
    "   - Plus feature flags like `ft_lndare`, `ft_fairwy`, `ft_tsslpt`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage Band Prioritization**: When multiple ENCs cover the same area, prioritizes higher-detail charts (band 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 > 1)\n",
    "4. **Reverse Edge Propagation**: Copies feature data to reverse edges in directed graphs\n",

    "### Why This Is Required\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static weights** need feature layers to calculate distance-based penalties/bonuses\n",
    "- **Directional weights** need traffic orientation data to align routes with traffic flow\n",
    "- **Dynamic weights** need depth and clearance data for vessel-specific constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Database-side spatial joins with R-tree indexes provide 10-20x faster performance than loading data into Python memory. Processing 100,000 edges typically takes 10-30 seconds."

    "### Three-Tier Weight Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 1: Blocking Weights (`wt_static_blocking`)\n",
    "Absolute avoidance zones that make edges effectively impassable:\n",
    "- **Land areas** (`lndare`): weight factor = 100\n",
    "- **Underwater rocks** (`uwtroc`): weight factor = 100\n",
    "- **Shoreline constructions** (`slcons`): weight factor = 90\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 2: Penalty Weights (`wt_static_penalty`)\n",
    "Areas to avoid when possible (currently unused in this configuration, but can be configured for anchorages, restricted zones, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 3: Bonus Weights (`wt_static_bonus`)\n",
    "Preferred routing areas with reduced costs:\n",
    "- **Fairways** (`fairwy`): weight factor = 0.5 (50% cost reduction)\n",
    "- **Traffic Separation Schemes** (`tsslpt`): weight factor = 0.7\n",
    "- **Dredged areas** (`drgare`): weight factor = 0.9\n",
    "- **Precautionary areas** (`prcare`): weight factor = 0.9\n",
    "- **Recommended tracks** (`rectrc`, `dwrtcl`): weight factor = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance-Based Degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight intensity is based on distance from features:\n",
    "- Each feature has an influence **buffer zone** (e.g., 500m for rocks, 200m for fairways)\n",
    "- **Inside buffer**: Full weight factor applied\n",
    "- **Outside buffer**: Neutral weight (1.0)\n",
    "- This creates smooth transitions rather than hard boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses SpatiaLite `ST_DWithin()` with R-tree spatial indexes for efficient buffer queries. All weight calculations happen database-side without loading data into Python memory."

    "## 6. Apply Directional Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate **traffic flow alignment penalties and rewards** based on how well edges align with intended maritime traffic directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Directional Weights Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uses enriched orientation data** from the previous enrichment step:\n",
    "   - `ft_orient`: Intended traffic direction (0-360 degrees) from TSS lanes, fairways, and recommended tracks\n",
    "   - `ft_trafic`: Traffic direction code (1=one-way, 2=two-way)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculates edge bearing** using SpatiaLite trigonometry:\n",
    "   - `ST_Azimuth()` computes the bearing from start node to end node\n",
    "   - Converted to 0-360 degree format for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computes angular difference** between edge bearing and traffic orientation:\n",
    "   - Handles 0-360 wrap-around (e.g., difference between 5\u00b0 and 355\u00b0 is 10\u00b0, not 350\u00b0)\n",
    "   - Determines alignment quality\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applies graduated penalties/rewards**:\n",
    "   - **Well-aligned** (0-30\u00b0): weight = 0.8 (20% faster)\n",
    "   - **Moderately aligned** (30-150\u00b0): weight = 1.5 (50% slower)\n",
    "   - **Opposite direction** (150-210\u00b0): weight = 3.0 (strongly discouraged)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Way Traffic Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "For features marked as two-way traffic (`ft_trafic=2`):\n",
    "- System checks if the reverse edge is well-aligned\n",
    "- If reverse edge has good alignment, allows travel in both directions\n",
    "- Prevents penalizing legitimate bidirectional routes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affected Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional weights are applied to:\n",
    "- **Traffic Separation Schemes** (`tsslpt`): One-way shipping lanes\n",
    "- **Fairways** (`fairwy`): Main navigation channels\n",
    "- **Recommended tracks** (`rectrc`, `dwrtcl`): Preferred routes\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures routes follow established maritime traffic patterns and avoid wrong-way travel."

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### What You've Created\n\n1. **Directed Graph**: Undirected graph converted to support directional routing, enabling traffic flow alignment\n2. **Enriched Edges**: All edges now have S-57 feature attributes (depth, orientation, clearance, etc.)\n3. **Three-Tier Weights**: Edges have static, directional, and dynamic weights combined into `adjusted_weight`\n4. **Optimal Route**: A route computed using the final weighted graph that balances:\n   - Safe passage (avoiding land, shallow areas, overhead hazards)\n   - Traffic compliance (following fairways, TSS lanes, recommended tracks)\n   - Vessel constraints (draft, height, type-specific preferences)\n   - Environmental factors (weather, visibility, time of day)\n\n### Understanding the Weights\n\nThe final `adjusted_weight` on each edge combines:\n```\nadjusted_weight = base_distance \u00d7 blocking_factor \u00d7 penalty_factor \u00d7 bonus_factor \u00d7 directional_weight\n```\n\nWhere:\n- **base_distance**: Original edge length (nautical miles)\n- **blocking_factor**: Absolute obstacles (land, shallow water) - high = impassable\n- **penalty_factor**: Areas to avoid (environmental conditions, hazards)\n- **bonus_factor**: Preferred areas (fairways, TSS lanes, dredged channels) - <1.0 = encouraged\n- **directional_weight**: Traffic flow alignment (follow one-way lanes, align with fairways)\n\n### Key Differences: File-Based vs PostGIS\n\nThis GeoPackage workflow provides:\n- **Portability**: No database server required - all data in single .gpkg file\n- **Performance**: SpatiaLite database-side operations (10-20x faster than Python memory)\n- **Simplicity**: Works on any system with GDAL/GeoPandas, no PostgreSQL setup needed\n- **Scalability**: Can handle graphs with millions of nodes/edges efficiently\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**For Further Analysis:**\n- Examine route segments in QGIS to understand routing decisions\n- Compare routes with different vessel parameters (draft, height)\n- Analyze weight distributions to identify bottleneck areas\n- Validate against real-world maritime practices\n\n**For Production Use:**\n- Store final weighted graphs in version control (small .gpkg files)\n- Create multiple graphs for different regions/scales\n- Build batch routing workflows for multiple vessel types\n- Integrate routes into navigation systems, ETA calculators, or fuel estimation tools\n- Update weighting factors based on operational experience and feedback\n\n**For Performance Optimization:**\n- Review benchmark metrics (`benchmark_graph_weighted_directed_gpkg.csv`) to identify slow steps\n- Consider which features are most impactful for your area of operations\n- Experiment with different vessel parameters to understand weight sensitivities\n- Monitor edge enrichment performance (usually the longest step)\n- For very large graphs (>1M nodes), consider splitting by region\n\n### GeoPackage-Specific Tips\n\n**File Management:**\n- Keep backup copies of enriched graphs (expensive to recreate)\n- Compress .gpkg files with 7zip for archival (typically 70-80% reduction)\n- Use `layer='edges'` or `layer='nodes'` when reading from multi-layer GeoPackage\n\n**Performance Tuning:**\n- Increase `ram_cache_mb` in enrichment step for faster processing on systems with ample RAM\n- Ensure R-tree spatial indexes are created (`skip_layers_without_rtree=True`)\n- SpatiaLite SQL typically runs 10-20x faster than Python operations for spatial queries\n\n**Interoperability:**\n- GeoPackage files open in QGIS, ArcGIS, and most GIS software\n- Convert to PostGIS with `export_postgis_to_gpkg()` if transitioning to server-based workflows\n- Layer names and column names are preserved for compatibility\n\n### Performance Expectations\n\nTypical timing for different graph sizes (fine grid at 0.02-0.1 NM spacing):\n- **Small graphs** (10K-50K nodes): 5-15 min total pipeline\n- **Medium graphs** (50K-200K nodes): 15-45 min total pipeline  \n- **Large graphs** (200K-1M nodes): 1-3 hours total pipeline\n- **Edge enrichment** is typically 70% of time; directional/dynamic weights are fast\n\nSee performance summary and benchmarks above for your specific graph's timing."
