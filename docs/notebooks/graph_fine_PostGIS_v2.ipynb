    "@# Fine-Resolution Graph Creation from PostGIS\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates advanced maritime navigation graph creation using high-resolution grids and H3 hexagonal tessellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow covers:\n",
    "1. **Base Route Loading**: Import an existing base route to focus graph creation on relevant areas.\n",
    "2. **Route Buffering**: Create a buffer zone around the route to define the area of interest.\n",
    "3. **Area Slicing**: Optionally reduce the AOI to a specific geographic region for testing/optimization.\n",
    "4. **Fine Grid Generation**: Create high-density navigable grids (0.1-0.3 NM spacing) or H3 hexagonal grids.\n",
    "5. **Graph Construction**: Build NetworkX graphs with connectivity analysis and component filtering.\n",
    "6. **Efficient Persistence**: Save graphs to GeoPackage, PostGIS (standard), or PostGIS (optimized bulk insert).\n",
    "7. **Route Calculation**: Compute optimal paths on the fine-resolution graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds upon the base graph workflow by adding:\n",
    "- **Higher resolution grids** for precise routing near coastlines, channels, and harbors\n",
    "- **H3 hexagonal tessellation** as an alternative to regular square grids\n",
    "- **Performance optimization** techniques for handling large graphs (millions of nodes/edges)\n",
    "- **Multiple save strategies** to balance speed vs database integration\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires:\n",
    "1. **Base Route**: Pre-computed route from base graph workflow (stored in PostGIS `routes` schema)\n",
    "2. **ENC Data**: S-57 charts converted to PostGIS format (same as base graph requirements)\n",
    "3. **Graph Configuration**: YAML config file defining layers and H3 settings\n",
    "4. **Schema/Tables**:\n",
    "   - Route schema: `routes` (base route table)\n",
    "   - Graph schema: `graph` (for saving graph tables)\n",
    "   - ENC schema: `us_enc_all` (or your schema name)\n",
    "5. **PostgreSQL Environment**: Connection parameters configured in `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup Instructions:**\n",
    "See `docs/SETUP.md` for converting S-57 charts to PostGIS backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
    "If you encounter issues, see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common problems and solutions."
