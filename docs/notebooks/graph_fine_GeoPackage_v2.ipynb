    "# Fine-Resolution Graph Creation from GeoPackage/SpatiaLite\n\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates advanced maritime navigation graph creation using high-resolution grids and H3 hexagonal tessellation with file-based backends (GeoPackage or SpatiaLite).\n\n",
    "The workflow covers:\n",
    "1. **Base Route Loading**: Import an existing base route to focus graph creation on relevant areas.\n",
    "2. **Route Buffering**: Create a buffer zone around the route to define the area of interest.\n",
    "3. **Area Slicing**: Optionally reduce the AOI to a specific geographic region for testing/optimization.\n",
    "4. **Fine Grid Generation**: Create high-density navigable grids (0.1-0.3 NM spacing) or H3 hexagonal grids.\n",
    "5. **Graph Construction**: Build NetworkX graphs with connectivity analysis and component filtering.\n",
    "6. **Efficient Persistence**: Save graphs to GeoPackage format.\n",
    "7. **Route Calculation**: Compute optimal paths on the fine-resolution graph.\n\n",
    "This notebook builds upon the base graph workflow by adding:\n",
    "- **Higher resolution grids** for precise routing near coastlines, channels, and harbors\n",
    "- **H3 hexagonal tessellation** as an alternative to regular square grids\n",
    "- **Performance optimization** techniques for handling large graphs (millions of nodes/edges)\n",
    "- **File-based backends** (GeoPackage/SpatiaLite) for portability and offline use\n\n",
    "---\n\n",
    "## Required Data\n\n",
    "This notebook requires:\n",
    "1. **Base Route**: Pre-computed route from base graph workflow (stored in GeoPackage)\n",
    "2. **ENC Data**: S-57 charts converted to GeoPackage or SpatiaLite format\n",
    "3. **Graph Configuration**: YAML config file defining layers and H3 settings\n\n",
    "**Setup Instructions:**\n",
    "See `docs/SETUP.md` for converting S-57 charts to GeoPackage/SpatiaLite.\n\n",
    "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
    "If you encounter issues, see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common problems and solutions."
