    "# Base Graph Creation from PostGIS\n\nThis notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of creating a basic maritime navigation graph using S-57 data stored in a PostGIS database.\n\nThe workflow covers:\n1.  Defining an area of interest (AOI) between two ports.\n2.  Filtering Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) that cover the AOI.\n3.  Generating a navigable sea grid from the ENC data.\n4.  Constructing a `networkx` graph from the grid.\n5.  Performing a basic pathfinding operation on the resulting graph.\n\n---\n\n## Required Data\n\nThis notebook requires:\n1. **ENC Data**: S-57 charts converted to PostGIS format\n2. **Schema/Tables**:\n   - Main schema: `us_enc_all` (or your schema name)\n   - Required layers: `seaare`, `lndare`, `fairwy`, `drgare`, `tsslpt`, `prcare`\n3. **Port Data**: Standard or custom port definitions (included with package)\n4. **PostgreSQL Environment**: Connection parameters configured in `.env` file\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\nSee `docs/SETUP.md` for converting S-57 charts to PostGIS backend.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\nIf you encounter issues, see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common problems and solutions."
