   "source": "# Maritime Graph Weighting and Pathfinding Pipeline\n\nThis notebook provides a comprehensive, end-to-end workflow for applying intelligent weighting to a maritime navigation graph and calculating optimal routes.\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThis is **Step 3** in the four-step maritime routing pipeline:\n\n1. **Base Graph Creation** (`graph_PostGIS_v2.ipynb`): Creates coarse-resolution graph (0.3 NM spacing)\n2. **Fine/H3 Graph Creation** (`graph_fine_PostGIS_v2.ipynb`): Creates high-resolution graph (0.02-0.3 NM or hexagonal)\n3. **Graph Weighting & Pathfinding** (THIS NOTEBOOK): Applies intelligent weights and calculates routes\n4. Configuration & Orchestration: Use `maritime_graph_postgis_workflow.py` for full automation\n\n## What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook implements a **three-tier weighting system** that combines:\n\n1. **Conversion**: Converting an undirected graph to a directed one to support traffic-flow constraints.\n2. **Enrichment**: Adding S-57 feature data (depth, clearance, orientation) to graph edges for smart routing.\n3. **Weighting**: Applying three tiers of weights:\n   - **Static weights**: Distance-based penalties/bonuses from navigational features (land, fairways, TSS lanes)\n   - **Directional weights**: Traffic flow alignment penalties/rewards (follow one-way lanes, align with fairways)\n   - **Dynamic weights**: Vessel-specific constraints (draft, height, environmental conditions)\n4. **Pathfinding**: Calculating optimal routes on the fully weighted graph using A* algorithm.\n\nThe entire pipeline is optimized for large graphs by performing all intensive operations directly within the PostGIS database. The graph is only loaded into memory at the final pathfinding step.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis notebook requires:\n1. **Directed Graph** (or will create from undirected): Pre-computed fine/H3 graph from Step 2\n2. **ENC Data**: S-57 charts converted to PostGIS format\n3. **Configuration Files**:\n   - `maritime_workflow_config.yml`: Workflow settings (vessel parameters, weights configuration)\n   - `graph_config.yml`: Graph layer definitions and weight settings\n4. **Database Setup**: PostGIS database with populated ENC schema\n5. **Environment**: `.env` file with database credentials\n\n**Setup Instructions:** See `docs/SETUP.md` for converting S-57 data to PostGIS backend.\n\n**Troubleshooting:** See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues and solutions.",

You can run the entire weighting pipeline or toggle individual steps to skip completed operations.\n\n### Key Configuration Notes:\n- **Graph Names**: Must match output from fine/H3 graph creation step (Step 2)\n- **Workflow Steps**: Set to `False` to skip already-completed operations (useful for re-running portions)\n- **Vessel Parameters**: Adjust draft/height to match your specific vessel (affects navigable areas and route costs)\n- **Usage Bands**: Controls which ENC chart scales contribute to static weighting (Band 3-5 recommended for coastal navigation)\n\nSee `maritime_workflow_config.yml` for production-ready configuration with full parameter documentation.",

Assign different weights to forward and reverse directions\n2. Model one-way traffic lanes and channels\n3. Apply directional bonuses/penalties based on traffic flow\n4. Prepare for sophisticated routing that considers real-world constraints\n\n**How it works:** Each undirected edge (A-B) becomes two directed edges (A→B and B→A). Feature data is propagated to both directions during enrichment. The operation is performed entirely on the database side for maximum performance.",

Enrichment performs spatial joins to extract navigational data from S-57 ENC layers and attach it to graph edges.\n\n### What Gets Enriched\n\nThe enrichment process adds `ft_*` columns to edges for each relevant S-57 feature:\n- **Depth data** (`ft_depth`, `ft_valsou`): Water depth from soundings (for draft clearance checks)\n- **Orientation** (`ft_orient`, `ft_trafic`): Traffic flow direction from TSS/fairways (for directional weights)\n- **Clearance** (`ft_verclr`): Vertical clearance from bridges/cables (for height checks)\n- **Feature presence** (`ft_lndare`, `ft_fairwy`, `ft_tsslpt`, etc.): Which feature types affect each edge\n- **Safety characteristics**: Sounding values, construction types, precautionary area flags\n\n### Why This is Required\n\nAll downstream weighting steps depend on this enriched data:\n- **Static weights** need feature layers (`ft_lndare`, `ft_fairwy`, etc.) to calculate distance-based penalties/bonuses\n- **Directional weights** need `ft_orient` and `ft_trafic` to align routes with traffic flow\n- **Dynamic weights** need `ft_depth` and `ft_verclr` to enforce vessel-specific constraints\n\n### Performance Note\n\nThis step can take 10-30 minutes for large graphs but only needs to be run once. All feature data is stored permanently in the edge table for subsequent weight calculations and is reusable for any routing scenario.\n\n### Data Propagation\n\nWhen `is_directed=True`, features are propagated to reverse edges to ensure bidirectional data consistency. This means:\n- Forward edge (A→B) gets features from feature geometries\n- Reverse edge (B→A) gets the same features\n- Directional properties can then be applied differently to each direction during directional weighting",

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### What You've Created\n\n1. **Directed Graph** (`h3_graph_directed_pg_6_11`): Undirected graph converted to support directional routing\n2. **Enriched Edges**: All edges now have S-57 feature attributes (depth, orientation, clearance, etc.)\n3. **Three-Tier Weights**: Edges have static, directional, and dynamic weights combined into `adjusted_weight`\n4. **Optimal Route**: A route computed using the final weighted graph that balances:\n   - Safe passage (avoiding land, shallow areas, overhead hazards)\n   - Traffic compliance (following fairways, TSS lanes, recommended tracks)\n   - Vessel constraints (draft, height, type-specific preferences)\n   - Environmental factors (weather, visibility, time of day)\n\n### Understanding the Weights\n\nThe final `adjusted_weight` on each edge combines:\n```\nadjusted_weight = base_distance × blocking_factor × penalty_factor × bonus_factor × directional_weight\n```\n\nWhere:\n- **base_distance**: Original edge length (nautical miles)\n- **blocking_factor**: Absolute obstacles (land, shallow water) - high = impassable\n- **penalty_factor**: Areas to avoid (environmental conditions, hazards)\n- **bonus_factor**: Preferred areas (fairways, TSS lanes, dredged channels) - <1.0 = encouraged\n- **directional_weight**: Traffic flow alignment (follow one-way lanes, align with fairways)\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**For Further Analysis:**\n- Examine route segments in QGIS to understand routing decisions\n- Compare routes with different vessel parameters (draft, height)\n- Analyze weight distributions to identify bottleneck areas\n- Validate against real-world maritime practices\n\n**For Production Use:**\n- Use `maritime_graph_postgis_workflow.py` for automated full pipeline (Steps 1-4)\n- Configure `maritime_workflow_config.yml` with your specific parameters\n- Integrate routes into navigation systems, ETA calculators, or fuel estimation tools\n- Update weighting factors based on operational experience and feedback\n\n**For Performance Optimization:**\n- Review benchmark metrics (`benchmark_graph_weighted_directed.csv`) to identify slow steps\n- Consider using optimized save methods for future large graphs\n- Experiment with different vessel parameters to understand weight sensitivities\n- Profile the weighting steps that take longest for your specific AOI\n\n### Benchmark Results\n\nSee the performance summary above for timing data on each step. Key metrics:\n- **Edge Enrichment**: Usually the longest step (10-30 min) but runs once\n- **Directional Weights**: Depends on feature coverage (5-15 min)\n- **Dynamic Weights**: Combines all factors (~5-10 min)\n- **Graph Loading**: Only needed for in-memory pathfinding (~10 min for large graphs)\n- **Route Calculation**: Fast once graph is loaded (<1 min)",
