    "This notebook provides a comprehensive, end-to-end workflow for processing a maritime navigation graph. It covers:\n",
    "1.  **Conversion**: Converting an undirected graph to a directed one.\n",
    "2.  **Enrichment**: Adding S-57 feature data (depth, clearance, orientation) to graph edges.\n",
    "3.  **Weighting**: Applying a three-tier system of static, directional, and dynamic (vessel-specific) weights.\n",
    "4.  **Pathfinding**: Calculating an optimal route on the fully weighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire pipeline is optimized for large graphs by performing all intensive operations directly within the PostGIS database. The graph is only loaded into memory at the final pathfinding step."
