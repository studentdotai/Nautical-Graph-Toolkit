    "# Maritime Graph Weighting and Pathfinding Pipeline\n\nThis notebook provides a comprehensive, end-to-end workflow for applying intelligent weighting to a maritime navigation graph and calculating optimal routes.\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThis is **Step 3** in the four-step maritime routing pipeline:\n\n1. **Base Graph Creation** (`graph_PostGIS_v2.ipynb`): Creates coarse-resolution graph (0.3 NM spacing)\n2. **Fine/H3 Graph Creation** (`graph_fine_PostGIS_v2.ipynb`): Creates high-resolution graph (0.02-0.3 NM or hexagonal)\n3. **Graph Weighting & Pathfinding** (THIS NOTEBOOK): Applies intelligent weights and calculates routes\n4. Configuration & Orchestration: Use `maritime_graph_postgis_workflow.py` for full automation\n\n## What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook implements a **three-tier weighting system** that combines:\n\n1. **Conversion**: Converting an undirected graph to a directed one to support traffic-flow constraints.\n2. **Enrichment**: Adding S-57 feature data (depth, clearance, orientation) to graph edges for smart routing.\n3. **Weighting**: Applying three tiers of weights:\n   - **Static weights**: Distance-based penalties/bonuses from navigational features (land, fairways, TSS lanes)\n   - **Directional weights**: Traffic flow alignment penalties/rewards (follow one-way lanes, align with fairways)\n   - **Dynamic weights**: Vessel-specific constraints (draft, height, environmental conditions)\n4. **Pathfinding**: Calculating optimal routes on the fully weighted graph using A* algorithm.\n\nThe entire pipeline is optimized for large graphs by performing all intensive operations directly within the PostGIS database. The graph is only loaded into memory at the final pathfinding step.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis notebook requires:\n1. **Directed Graph** (or will create from undirected): Pre-computed fine/H3 graph from Step 2\n2. **ENC Data**: S-57 charts converted to PostGIS format\n3. **Configuration Files**:\n   - `maritime_workflow_config.yml`: Workflow settings (vessel parameters, weights configuration)\n   - `graph_config.yml`: Graph layer definitions and weight settings\n4. **Database Setup**: PostGIS database with populated ENC schema\n5. **Environment**: `.env` file with database credentials\n\n**Setup Instructions:** See `docs/SETUP.md` for converting S-57 data to PostGIS backend.\n\n**Troubleshooting:** See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues and solutions."

    "## 1. Notebook Configuration\n\nAdjust the parameters in this section to control the notebook's behavior. You can run the entire weighting pipeline or toggle individual steps to skip completed operations.\n\n### Key Configuration Notes:\n- **Graph Names**: Must match output from fine/H3 graph creation step (Step 2)\n- **Workflow Steps**: Set to `False` to skip already-completed operations (useful for re-running portions)\n- **Vessel Parameters**: Adjust draft/height to match your specific vessel (affects navigable areas and route costs)\n- **Usage Bands**: Controls which ENC chart scales contribute to static weighting (Band 3-5 recommended for coastal navigation)\n\nSee `maritime_workflow_config.yml` for production-ready configuration with full parameter documentation."

    "## 3. Convert to Directed Graph\n\n**Why this step is needed:** The undirected fine/H3 graph treats edges bidirectionally. However, maritime traffic often has directional rules:\n- One-way traffic lanes (Traffic Separation Schemes)\n- Current/wind patterns that favor certain directions\n- Fairway orientation preferences\n\nConverting to a directed graph allows us to:\n1. Assign different weights to forward and reverse directions\n2. Model one-way traffic lanes and channels\n3. Apply directional bonuses/penalties based on traffic flow\n4. Prepare for sophisticated routing that considers real-world constraints\n\n**How it works:** Each undirected edge (A-B) becomes two directed edges (A→B and B→A). Feature data is propagated to both directions during enrichment. The operation is performed entirely on the database side for maximum performance."

    "## 4. Enrich Edges with S-57 Features\n\nThis is a **critical prerequisite** for all weighting steps. Enrichment performs spatial joins to extract navigational data from S-57 ENC layers and attach it to graph edges.\n\n### What Gets Enriched\n\nThe enrichment process adds `ft_*` columns to edges for each relevant S-57 feature:\n- **Depth data** (`ft_depth`, `ft_valsou`): Water depth from soundings (for draft clearance checks)\n- **Orientation** (`ft_orient`, `ft_trafic`): Traffic flow direction from TSS/fairways (for directional weights)\n- **Clearance** (`ft_verclr`): Vertical clearance from bridges/cables (for height checks)\n- **Feature presence** (`ft_lndare`, `ft_fairwy`, `ft_tsslpt`, etc.): Which feature types affect each edge\n- **Safety characteristics**: Sounding values, construction types, precautionary area flags\n\n### Why This is Required\n\nAll downstream weighting steps depend on this enriched data:\n- **Static weights** need feature layers (`ft_lndare`, `ft_fairwy`, etc.) to calculate distance-based penalties/bonuses\n- **Directional weights** need `ft_orient` and `ft_trafic` to align routes with traffic flow\n- **Dynamic weights** need `ft_depth` and `ft_verclr` to enforce vessel-specific constraints\n\n### Performance Note\n\nThis step can take 10-30 minutes for large graphs but only needs to be run once. All feature data is stored permanently in the edge table for subsequent weight calculations and is reusable for any routing scenario.\n\n### Data Propagation\n\nWhen `is_directed=True`, features are propagated to reverse edges to ensure bidirectional data consistency. This means:\n- Forward edge (A→B) gets features from feature geometries\n- Reverse edge (B→A) gets the same features\n- Directional properties can then be applied differently to each direction during directional weighting"

    "## 5. Apply Static Weights\n\nThis step applies **distance-based penalties and bonuses** from static S-57 features.

    "## 6. Apply Directional Weights\n\nThis step calculates **traffic flow alignment penalties and rewards** based on how well an edge aligns with the intended direction of maritime traffic features.\n\n### How Directional Weights Work\n\n1. **Uses enriched orientation data** (`ft_orient` and `ft_trafic` from enrichment step):\n   - `ft_orient`: The intended traffic direction (0-360 degrees) from features like TSS lanes and fairways\n   - `ft_trafic`: Traffic direction code (1=one-way, 2=two-way)\n\n2. **Calculates angular difference** between:\n   - Edge direction (from start node to end node)\n   - Feature orientation (intended traffic flow)\n\n3. **Applies penalties/rewards based on alignment**:\n   - **Aligned** (0-22.5°): Weight = 0.7 (30% cost reduction for following traffic)\n   - **Slightly off** (22.5-45°): Weight = 1.2 (20% penalty)\n   - **Moderately off** (45-90°): Weight = 5.0 (substantial penalty)\n   - **Opposite direction** (135-180°): Weight = 50.0 (strongly discouraged)\n\n4. **Two-way traffic handling**:\n   - For two-way lanes (`ft_trafic=2`), checks if reverse edge is well-aligned\n   - If reverse edge alignment > 95%, allows travel in both directions\n   - Prevents penalizing legitimate two-way routes\n\n### Affected Layers\n\nDirectional weights are applied to:\n- Traffic Separation Schemes (`tsslpt`): One-way shipping lanes\n- Fairways (`fairwy`): Main navigation channels\n- Recommended tracks (`rectrc`, `dwrtcl`): Preferred routes\n\nThis ensures routes follow established maritime traffic patterns and avoid wrong-way travel in one-way lanes."

Apply Dynamic (Vessel-Specific) Weights\n\nThis is the **final weighting step** that combines all previous weights with vessel-specific constraints to produce the `adjusted_weight` used for pathfinding.\n\n### Three-Tier Integration\n\nDynamic weights integrate all three tiers from previous steps:\n\n1. **Tier 1 - Blocking Factor**: \n   - Combines static blocking weights with vessel constraints\n   - Checks water depth (`ft_depth`) vs vessel draft + safety margin\n   - Checks vertical clearance (`ft_verclr`) vs vessel height\n   - Shallow water or low bridges result in extremely high weights (effectively blocking)\n\n2. **Tier 2 - Penalty Factor**:\n   - Combines static penalties with environmental conditions\n   - Applies weather and visibility factors (e.g., 1.2x for poor weather)\n   - Time-of-day adjustments (night navigation penalties)\n   - Results in moderate weight increases for less favorable conditions\n\n3. **Tier 3 - Bonus Factor**:\n   - Uses static bonus weights (fairways, TSS lanes, etc.)\n   - Applies vessel type preferences (cargo ships prefer deep channels)\n   - Results in weight reductions for preferred routes\n\n### Final Weight Calculation\n\nThe `adjusted_weight` for each edge is calculated as:\n```\nadjusted_weight = base_distance × blocking_factor × penalty_factor × bonus_factor × directional_weight\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `base_distance`: Original edge length in nautical miles (stored in `weight` column)\n- `blocking_factor`: From `wt_static_blocking` + depth/clearance checks\n- `penalty_factor`: From `wt_static_penalty` + environmental conditions\n- `bonus_factor`: From `wt_static_bonus` + vessel preferences\n- `directional_weight`: From `wt_dir` (traffic flow alignment)\n\n**Result**: Edges that are safe, aligned with traffic, in preferred areas, and suitable for the vessel get low weights (preferred). Edges that are dangerous, misaligned, or unsuitable get high weights (avoided)."

    "## 10. Workflow Summary and Next Steps\n\nCongratulations! You've completed the weighting and pathfinding pipeline. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### What You've Created\n\n1. **Directed Graph** (`h3_graph_directed_pg_6_11`): Undirected graph converted to support directional routing\n2. **Enriched Edges**: All edges now have S-57 feature attributes (depth, orientation, clearance, etc.)\n3. **Three-Tier Weights**: Edges have static, directional, and dynamic weights combined into `adjusted_weight`\n4. **Optimal Route**: A route computed using the final weighted graph that balances:\n   - Safe passage (avoiding land, shallow areas, overhead hazards)\n   - Traffic compliance (following fairways, TSS lanes, recommended tracks)\n   - Vessel constraints (draft, height, type-specific preferences)\n   - Environmental factors (weather, visibility, time of day)\n\n### Understanding the Weights\n\nThe final `adjusted_weight` on each edge combines:\n```\nadjusted_weight = base_distance × blocking_factor × penalty_factor × bonus_factor × directional_weight\n```\n\nWhere:\n- **base_distance**: Original edge length (nautical miles)\n- **blocking_factor**: Absolute obstacles (land, shallow water) - high = impassable\n- **penalty_factor**: Areas to avoid (environmental conditions, hazards)\n- **bonus_factor**: Preferred areas (fairways, TSS lanes, dredged channels) - <1.0 = encouraged\n- **directional_weight**: Traffic flow alignment (follow one-way lanes, align with fairways)\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**For Further Analysis:**\n- Examine route segments in QGIS to understand routing decisions\n- Compare routes with different vessel parameters (draft, height)\n- Analyze weight distributions to identify bottleneck areas\n- Validate against real-world maritime practices\n\n**For Production Use:**\n- Use `maritime_graph_postgis_workflow.py` for automated full pipeline (Steps 1-4)\n- Configure `maritime_workflow_config.yml` with your specific parameters\n- Integrate routes into navigation systems, ETA calculators, or fuel estimation tools\n- Update weighting factors based on operational experience and feedback\n\n**For Performance Optimization:**\n- Review benchmark metrics (`benchmark_graph_weighted_directed.csv`) to identify slow steps\n- Consider using optimized save methods for future large graphs\n- Experiment with different vessel parameters to understand weight sensitivities\n- Profile the weighting steps that take longest for your specific AOI\n\n### Benchmark Results\n\nSee the performance summary above for timing data on each step. Key metrics:\n- **Edge Enrichment**: Usually the longest step (10-30 min) but runs once\n- **Directional Weights**: Depends on feature coverage (5-15 min)\n- **Dynamic Weights**: Combines all factors (~5-10 min)\n- **Graph Loading**: Only needed for in-memory pathfinding (~10 min for large graphs)\n- **Route Calculation**: Fast once graph is loaded (<1 min)"
