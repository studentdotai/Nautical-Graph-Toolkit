NOTES:

NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard light list.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling particularly at the edges.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian and British Surveys.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


COLREGS, 80.1385, 80.1390 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - NOTE I
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system has been established by the United States and Canada within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region. The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Prince Rupert Traffic, Seattle Traffic, Victoria Traffic) administers the rules issued by both nations, however, it will enforce only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction. 


PUGET SOUND HARBOR SAFETY PLAN
The US Coast Guard and the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee have developed and adopted a Harbor Safety Plan that formally established a set of Standards of Care for Puget Sound and surrounding waters. These Standards of Care are intended to supplement existing regulations by documenting good marine practices for a variety of operations including tug escorts, pilotage, anchoring, lightering, and provides additional information on required charts, Aids to Navigation and Emergency Response. If your vessel does not already have a copy of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Plan, visit https://marexps.com/membership/puget-sound-harbor-safety-committee/ or contact the Marine Exchange of Puget Sound at (206) 443-3830.


CANADIAN WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The Canadian Weather Service station listed below provides continuous marine weather broadcasts. The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site.

Vancouver, B.C.		CFA-240		162.400MHz   


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels. For more information visit https://navigation.usace.army.mil/Survey/Hydro/ .
