NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Detroit, Michigan. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see the U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard. 


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed.  For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


PLANE OF REFERENCE OF THIS CHART
Plane of Reference of this chart (Low Water Datum) 176.0 meters/577.5 feet. Referred to mean water level at Rimouski, Quebec, International Great Lakes Datum (1985).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations. 

Traverse City, MI       KIH-22      162.400 MHz
Wolf Lake, MI           WNG-672 	162.425 MHz


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses are recommended by the Lake Carriers Association and the Chamber of Marine Commerce as voluntary guidance for course to steer with navigation safety and Collision Regulations always taking priority.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
