NOTES:
LIDAR SURVEYS: 
Much of the hydrography on this chart is based on surveys using Laser Image Detection and Ranging, or LIDAR. The ability of LIDAR to detect depths and hazards is limited by water conditions, such as water clarity, depth and the state of the sea surface. Therefore, certain LIDAR-surveyed areas are not thoroughly examined, particularly in areas with depths greater than 20 meters. In such areas, additional sources may have been used. See M_QUAL for detailed limits of survey areas.

TIDES AND CURRENTS:
The height of the tide and direction of current are influenced greatly by the wind. In general, the tidal current sets onto the bank from all directions on the flood tide, and off on the ebb. Near Double Headed Shot Cays, the tidal currents are rotary. In Santaren Channel, a current of moderate or low constancy flows NW at about 0.7 knot, joining the Florida Current at the channel's NW end. In Nicolas Channel, a weak current generally sets W or NW, but an E or SE current may encroach into the channel's W end. For tidal information see the NOS tide table publication or go to https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/.

CAUTION - CAY SAL ISLAND:
The shallow waters around the entire island of Cay Sal contain numerous coral heads and coral reef areas. Many of these coral heads and coral reef areas are not shown in this chart. Use extreme caution when anchoring in the vicinity of these shallow waters. See Sailing Directions for further information.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES:
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-marine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS:
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER:
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See paragraph No. 1 of Notice to Mariners No. 1 or Sailing Directions Planning Guide for information relative to NGA Charts.

NOTE A:
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, Florida. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

POLLUTION REPORTS:
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
The Traffic Separation Scheme on this chart is adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). For details of the vessel traffic service and reporting systems, see Sailing Directions.
