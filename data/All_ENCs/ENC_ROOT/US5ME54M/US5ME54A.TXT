NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 1. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers. 

	
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the Canadian Hydrographic Service with additional data from the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, International Boundary Commission, U.S. Geological Survey, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian Ministry of Transport.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot No. 1 and Canadian Sailing Directions, Nova Scotia (SE Coast) and Bay of Fundy, for important supplemental information.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Ellsworth, ME            	KEC-93	    162.400 MHz
Jonesboro Marine, ME    	WNG-543     162.450 MHz


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details, see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - FISH TRAP AREAS
Numerous uncharted fish traps may exist shoreward of the 10 meter curve.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


COLREGS, 80.105 (SEE NOTE A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation line.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels.
