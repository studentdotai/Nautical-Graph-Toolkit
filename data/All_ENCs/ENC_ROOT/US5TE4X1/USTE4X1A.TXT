NOTES: 
CAUTION 1:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum with the use of 2018 orthorectified imagery. Many reefs on this chart have been updated. Such imagery cannot provide reliable detection of all hazards to navigation. Uncharted hazards may exist.

CAUTION 2
Uncharted rocks and coral heads, dangerous to navigation, may exist outside the limits of the swept area.

CAUTION 3:
Due to the existence of wrecks and cables, vessels are cautioned against anchoring within the atoll without first contacting local authorities.

CAUTION 4:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

CAUTION 5:
Pilotage, although not compulsory, is advisable due to uncharted dangers.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
