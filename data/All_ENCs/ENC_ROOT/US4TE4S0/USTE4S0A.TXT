NOTES:
GEA PASS:
Gea Pass, one of the main entrance channels, is used ordinarily by larger ships entering the lagoon.

LIDAR SURVEYS:
Some of the hydrography on this chart is based on surveys using air borne Light Detection and Ranging, or LIDAR. The ability of LIDAR to detect depths and hazards is limited by water conditions, such as water clarity, depth, and the state of the sea surface. Therefore, certain LIDAR-surveyed areas are not thoroughly examined, particularly in areas with depths greater than 30 meters. In such areas, additional sources may have been used. See M_QUAL for detailed limits of survey areas. Significant discrepancies have been observed between the older chart and survey data and the newer LIDAR survey. While the LIDAR data is accurate, the LIDAR survey cannot be exclusively relied on to produce an exact depiction of the sea floor. The mariner is warned to exercise caution in all areas of this chart, as uncharted hazards may exist. Local knowledge is recommended.

SOUNDINGS:
Soundings updated with trackline data from multiple sources dated 1963-1993.

POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum through the use of an orthorectified satellite image. Reefs updated with 2013-2014 commercial imagery.

CAUTION 1:
Many reefs on this chart have been updated through the use of Commercial satellite Imagery. Such imagery cannot provide reliable detection of all hazards to navigation. Uncharted hazards may exist.

CAUTION 2:
Uncharted rocks and coral heads, dangerous to navigation, may exist outside the limits of the swept area.

CAUTION 3:
Pilotage, although not compulsory in this area, is advisable due to uncharted dangers.

CAUTION 4:
Due to the existence of wrecks and cables, vessels are cautioned against anchoring within the atoll without first contacting local authorities.

CAUTION 5:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.
