NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, Washington. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian Authorities.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CANADIAN WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The Canadian Weather Service station listed below provides continuous marine weather broadcasts. The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site.

Vancouver, B.C.		CFA-240		162.400MHz


CAUTION - COOPERATIVE VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system has been established by the United States and Canada within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region. The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Prince Rupert Traffic, Seattle Traffic, Victoria Traffic) administers the rules issued by both nations, however, it will enforce only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


COLREGS, 80.1390 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Puget Sound Marine, WA 			WWG-24		162.425 MHz
H Street - Blaine Area, WA		KED-93		162.525 MHz


PUGET SOUND HARBOR SAFETY PLAN
The US Coast Guard and the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee have developed and adopted a Harbor Safety Plan that formally established a set of Standards of Care for Puget Sound and surrounding waters. These Standards of Care are intended to supplement existing regulations by documenting good marine practices for a variety of operations including tug escorts, pilotage, anchoring, lightering, and provides additional information on required charts, Aids to Navigation and Emergency Response. If your vessel does not already have a copy of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Plan, visit https://marexps.com/membership/puget-sound-harbor-safety-committee/ or contact the Marine Exchange of Puget Sound at (206) 443-3830.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


REGULATED NAVIGATION AREA
A Regulated Navigation Area has been established by the U.S. Coast Guard. Please see Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10 or 33 CFR 165.1301 and 33 CFR 165.1303.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES AREA
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system in the Puget Sound area. Vessel operating procedures and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, Chapter 2 U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners should consult these sources for applicable rules and reporting requirements. The entire area of the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
