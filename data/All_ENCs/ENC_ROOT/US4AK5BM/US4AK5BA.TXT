NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Geological Survey.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.  


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK		WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Kodiak, AK		WXJ-78		162.550 MHz
Homer, AK		WXJ-24		162.400 MHz
Cape Gull, AK		WNG-529		162.500 MHz
Marmot Island, AK	WNG-716		162.500 MHz


COLREGS, 80.1705
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


LOCAL MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE
Differences of as much as 3° from the normal variation have been observed in the inshore waters of this chart.


CAUTION
Tidal observations made by the National Ocean Service since the earthquake of March 27, 1964, indicate bottom subsidence at the following locations:

Subsidence (feet)
Uganik Bay	 	-3.7
Kodiak			-5.8

Mariners are cautioned to expect shoaling or deepening for the areas listed.  Tidal observations at this time are at selected sites and the magnitude of the changes except at these sites is not known.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
