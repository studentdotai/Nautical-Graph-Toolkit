Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Navy and Japanese surveys.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL are approximate due to generalization for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL (Quality of data) represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.
