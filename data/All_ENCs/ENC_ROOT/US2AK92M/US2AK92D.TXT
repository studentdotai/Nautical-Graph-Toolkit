CAUTION - HAULOUT AREA
In an effort to prevent disturbance to walruses in this important haulout area, marine vessel operators are requested by the Native Village of Point Lay to remain 5 nautical miles offshore. If vessels must transit closer for safety or operational reasons, please observe the following guidelines: Vessels less than 50 feet / 15.2 meters in length remain at least 0.5 nautical miles offshore. Vessels 50 feet or more but less than 100 feet / 30.5 meters in length should remain at least 1 nautical mile offshore. Vessels 100 feet / 30.5 meters or more in length should remain at least 3 nautical miles haulout offshore. All vessels should refrain from anchoring within 3 nautical miles of a walrus haulout. Please maintain a 1 nautical mile buffer from active walrus haulouts when loading or unloading barge cargo at Point Lay.
