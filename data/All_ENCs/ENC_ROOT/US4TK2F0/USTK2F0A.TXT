NOTE:
The original soundings were in fathoms.

CELL ACCURACY:
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some details on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum with the use of 2019 orthorectified imagery. However the hydrography is based on Japanese survey in 1926 with additions from U.S. Navy survey to 1959 and random track data to 1991.

CAUTION 1:
Bikini Atoll, from 1946 to 1963, was used as an nuclear proving grounds. The hydrographic and topographic detail shown on this chart is subject to constant change and cannot always be relied upon.  Due to the possibility of undetected coral heads, great caution should be used when navigating in unswept areas.

CAUTION 2:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 126, Sailing Directions, for important supplemental information.
