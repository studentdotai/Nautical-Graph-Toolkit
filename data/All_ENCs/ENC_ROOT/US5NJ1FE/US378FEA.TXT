NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Philadelphia, PA. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 3 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


BROADCASTS OF MARINE WEATHER FORECASTS AND WARNINGS BY MARINE RADIOTELEPHONE STATIONS
CITY           STATION   FREQ.     BROADCAST TIMES - EST    SPECIAL WARNING
Cape May, NJ   NMK       2670kHz   6:03 AM & PM             On receipt

Distress calls for small craft are made on 2182 kHz or channel 16 (156.80MHz) VHF.


CAUTION - ALL CRAFT
All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - OYSTER GROUNDS
Oyster grounds are marked by stakes and flags. Submerged broken stakes become dangerous obstructions to small craft.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels even if small craft have the right-of-way. All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Undetected features hazardous to surface navigation may exist in federal channels, as might shoaling, particularly along the edges of channels. For more information visit https://navigation.usace.army.mil/Survey/Hydro/ .


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY
PROJECT DEPTHS: The project depth is 1.8 meters/6 feet Manasquan Inlet, NJ to Ottens Harbor, NJ; 3.0 meters/10 feet Otters Harbor, NJ to Richardson Channel, NJ; 3.6 meters/12 feet Richardson Channel, NJ to Cape May Inlet, NJ.

Consult the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for controlling depths and U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners for other navigation hazards or restrictions. Uncharted shoals may exist in areas which have not been recently surveyed. Please report shoals and obstructions at: https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/customer-service/assist/ .

DISTANCES: The general location of the Waterway is indicated. Mariners are advised to follow the aids to navigation and avoid charted shoals and obstructions. Mileage distances shown along the Waterway are in Statute Miles, Southward from Manasquan Inlet Entrance (US5NJ30M) and are indicated. One Statute Mile equals 0.87 Nautical Miles / 1.6 Kilometers. Courses are TRUE and must be CORRECTED for any variation and compass deviation.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with nautical charts, and the exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart is consulted. Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibits unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waterways. When following the Intracoastal Waterway southward from Manasquan Inlet to Cape May, NJ, aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the starboard of the vessel and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side of the vessel. A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway. All lights and lighted buoys marking the Intracoastal Waterway on this chart show a flash every four seconds, unless otherwise specified. The aids marking tributary channels, in general, are maintained by the state of New Jersey.
