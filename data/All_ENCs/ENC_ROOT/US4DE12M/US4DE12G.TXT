MISPILLION RIVER
The Corps of Engineers has confirmed (September 2013) that the channel past the jetties in the Mispillion River to Milford remains an authorized navigation project and has not been actively maintained since 1981. There are no plans to survey this project in the foreseeable future.
The controlling depth after the jetties was 0.6 meters/2 feet to the bascule bridge with shoaling to 0.3 meters/1 foot after the jetties, thence 0.6 meters/2 feet to Milford with shoaling to 0.3 meters/1 foot at Milford.
