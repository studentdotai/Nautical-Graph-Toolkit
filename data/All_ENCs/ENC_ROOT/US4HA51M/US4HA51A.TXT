NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.
 

NOTE B
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in these waters. Proceed with caution.


NOTE - FISH AGGREGATING DEVICES
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADS) are established along the coastal waters of the main Hawaiian Islands.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Mt Kaala, HI	   KBA-99	162.550 MHz
Hawaii Kai, HI	   KBA-99	162.400 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES 
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html. 


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels. For more information visit https://navigation.usace.army.mil/Survey/Hydro/ .
