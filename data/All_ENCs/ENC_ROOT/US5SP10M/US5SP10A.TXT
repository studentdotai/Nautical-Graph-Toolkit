NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 126 or weekly Notice to Mariners which include new or revised regulations. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii. Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers.


SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
For Symbols and Abbreviations, see Chart No. 1.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 126 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL are approximate due to generalization for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL (Quality of data) represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overally zone of confidence. 


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.


COLREGS, 80.1495
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.	


SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exists, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


PROHIBITED AREA, WAKE ISLAND
Regulations are published in National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication No. 126.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
