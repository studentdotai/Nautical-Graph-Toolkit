It is recommended that all vessels, particularly those which must navigate in the channel because of draft constraints, hereafter referred to as deep-draft vessels, strictly adhere to these guidelines. Nothing in them shall supersede nor alter any applicable laws or regulations. In complying with these guidelines, regard shall be given to all hazards to navigation and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from the guidelines necessary to avoid immediate danger. It is recommended that no vessel regardless of size anchor within a 1.7 NM radius of Tybee Lighted Buoy "T" LLNR 4530.
