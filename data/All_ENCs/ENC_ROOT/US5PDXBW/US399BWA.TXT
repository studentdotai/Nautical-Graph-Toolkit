NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Portland, Oregon. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION
Numerous obstructions found in 2009, consisting mainly of submerged snags and ruined piles, are not charted in the Willamette River north of the Sellwood Fixed Bridge. These obstructions do not present a hazard to surface navigation, but should be taken into consideration for ground fishing and anchoring.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are cautioned that a large number of logs and deadheads are adrift in the navigable waters of Oregon and Washington at all times, particularly after storms, spring freshets, and unusually high tides.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Portland, OR	KIG-98		162.55  MHz
Salem, OR		WXL-96		162.475 MHz
Davis Peak, WA		WGN-604		162.525 MHz


NOTE C
Rock Island Channel Buoys 1 through 15 are seasonal from May 15 to October 15.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


SOUNDING DATUMS
Soundings and Clearances of Bridges and Overhead Cables in the Willamette River from Portland to the locks at Oregon City referred to Columbia River Datum (Mean Lower Low Water During Lowest River Stages). Soundings above the locks are referred to Willamette River Datum which is 15.2 meters / 50 feet above Mean Sea Level. Clearances of Bridges and Overhead Cables above locks are referred to the Corps of Engineers datum for Newberg Pool which is 15.8 meters / 52 feet above Mean Sea Level.

At Willamette River Datum: This datum is 50 feet / 15.3 meters above mean sea level.


STATUTE MILES - WILLAMETTE RIVER
Mileage distances along the Willamette River are in Statute Miles. Distances along the Willamette River are southward from the junction of the Columbia River. Tables for converting Statute Miles to International Nautical Miles are given in Coast Pilot 10.


TIDES
The diurnal range of the tide at Portland 45°31'N/ 122° 40'W during lowest river stages is .7 meters / 2.4 feet. The range becomes progressively smaller with higher stages of the river.


WARNING - WILLAMETTE RIVER
Submerged logs are a constant danger to navigation in the Willamette River.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
