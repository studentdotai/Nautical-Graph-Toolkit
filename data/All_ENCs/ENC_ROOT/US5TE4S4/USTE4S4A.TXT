NOTES:

LIDAR SURVEYS:
Some of the hydrography on this chart is based on surveys using air borne Light Detection and Ranging, or LIDAR. The ability of LIDAR to detect depths and hazards is limited by water conditions, such as water clarity, depth, and the state of the sea surface. Therefore, certain LIDAR-surveyed areas are not thoroughly examined, particularly in areas with depths greater than 30 meters. In such areas, additional sources may have been used. See M_QUAL for detailed limits of survey areas. Significant discrepancies have been observed between the older chart and survey data and the newer LIDAR survey. While the LIDAR data is accurate, the LIDAR survey cannot be exclusively relied on to produce an exact depiction of the sea floor. The mariner is warned to exercise caution in all areas of this chart, as uncharted hazards may exist. Local knowledge is recommended.

CELL ACCURACY:
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some details on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum through the use of an orthorectified satellite image. Reefs updated with 2013-2014 commercial imagery.

CAUTION 1:
Pilotage, although not compulsory in this area, is advisable due to uncharted dangers.

CAUTION 2:
Due to the existence of wrecks and cables, vessels are cautioned against anchoring within the atoll without first contacting local authorities.

CAUTION 3:
Uncharted rocks and coral heads, dangerous to navigation, may exist outside the limits of the swept area.

CAUTION 4:
Fairway was dredged in 1979, but not regularly maintained.

CAUTION 5:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
