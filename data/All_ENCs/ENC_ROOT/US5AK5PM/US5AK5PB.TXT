Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when attempting to navigate Whale Passage at times of maximum current. During these periods, floating aids to navigation may be dragged under or off station. When large tides occur, the currents may reach velocities of 4.5 to 5.5 knots, creating boils and swirls.
