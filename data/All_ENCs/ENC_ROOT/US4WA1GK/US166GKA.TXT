NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, Washington. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


ANCHORING STANDARDS OF CARE
Anchoring Standards of Care have been established for this area through the Harbor Safety Plan. These Standards of Care supplement existing regulations with good marine practices for anchoring, and are separated into different weather categories. If your vessel does not have a copy of the Anchoring Standards of Care, you can download one at https://marexps.com/membership/puget-sound-harbor-safety-committee/ or contact the Marine Exchange of Puget Sound at (206) 443-3830.


BROADCASTS OF MARINE WEATHER FORECASTS AND WARNINGS BY MARINE RADIOTELEPHONE STATIONS
CITY		STATION		FREQ.		BROADCAST TIMES - PST	SPECIAL WARNING
Seattle, Wash.	NMW-43		157.1 MHz	9:30 AM			*On receipt

* Preceded by announcement on 2182 kHz and 156.8 MHz Distress calls for small craft are made on 2182 kHz or channel 16 (156.80 MHz) VHF.


CAUTION - RIPRAP
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the protective riprap surrounding navigational light structures.


CAUTION - FIXED AND FLOATING OBSTRUCTIONS
Fixed and floating obstructions, some submerged, may exist along shore of Lake Washington. Mariners are advised to proceed with caution.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are cautioned that a large number of logs and deadheads are adrift in the navigable waters of Oregon and Washington at all times, particularly after storms, spring freshets, and unusually high tides.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels even if small craft have the right-of-way. All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Undetected features hazardous to surface navigation may exist in federal channels, as might shoaling, particularly along the edges of channels. For more information visit https://navigation.usace.army.mil/Survey/Hydro/.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


COLREGS, 80.1395 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


FISHING NET CONFLICT RESOLUTION
During certain seasons fishing net conflict may occur in this area, most commonly in the vicinity of the Duwamish waterway. It is in the best interest of all mariners to verify a clear channel prior to entering this area. All fishermen must comply with 72 COLREGS. For more Information please contact Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Puget Sound at (206)217-6230/6231.


LAKE WASHINGTON SHIP CANAL - BRIDGE SIGNALS
The signal to open bridges is one prolonged blast followed by one short blast of whistle or horn for all bridges across the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Five short blasts of whistle or horn from any bridge indicates the draw is not ready to be opened immediately.


LAKE WASHINGTON SHIP CANAL - SPEED LIMITS
Speed limit is 7 knots from Hiram M. Chittenden Locks to Webster Point Light (Lake Washington), except in Lake Union test area marked by four buoys.


LOCK SIGNAL
The signal to open locks is two long blasts followed by three short blasts of whistle or horn for vessels with tows, and two long blasts followed by two short blasts for all other vessels. Bridge and navigation regulations, including special regulations for transit over the Salt Water Barrier in the Hiram Chittenden Locks, are published in U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Copies of the regulation may be obtained at the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, in Seattle. Refer to Section number 207.750 for navigation regulations and section number 117.795 for bridge regulations.
