ALTERNATE ROUTE
The U.S. Coast Guard has established an alternate route for vessels transiting inbound from the Intracoastal Waterway to the Houston Ship Channel. The alternate route is marked with a 300° T head range, and is in naturally deep water. Houston Traffic requests that all vessels proceeding northbound in the alternate route conduct a Sécurité broadcast of their intentions prior to entering into the Houston Ship Channel. Outbound tows normally proceed south to Houston Ship Channel Buoy 26, then east to Point Bolivar.
