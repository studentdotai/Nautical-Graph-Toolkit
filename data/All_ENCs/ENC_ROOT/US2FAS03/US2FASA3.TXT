CELL ACCURACY
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some details on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

S-57 DATASETS ON UNSPECIFIED DATUM
Positions obtained from Global Navigation Satellite Systems, such as GPS, are normally referred to WGS84 Datum. The differences between satellite-derived positions and positions on this cell cannot be accurately determined; the estimated value of the difference for this region of the chart lies within +/- 2280 meters of WGS84 Datum. Mariners are warned that these differences MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO NAVIGATION and are therefore advised to confirm GPS positions shown in the chart display using alternative navigational techniques particularly when closing the shore or navigating in the vicinity of dangers.

FISH AGGREGATION DEVICES
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult NGA List of Lights Pub. 111 for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.
