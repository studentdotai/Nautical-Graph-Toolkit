CAUTION - CHANGEABLE AREA
Fire Island Inlet is subject to frequent changes. Buoys are not charted because they are moved periodically to mark the best passage. Charted hydrography from the entrance buoy to Democrat Point is from surveys dated from Mar 2019 to Apr 2022. Mariners are warned to beware of extreme tidal turbulence, especially during times of tidal change.
