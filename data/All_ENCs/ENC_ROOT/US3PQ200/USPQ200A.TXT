CAUTION 1 - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.

CAUTION 2:
Detailed information has been omitted or generalized covered by larger scale data. In this area, only the principal aids to navigation are maintained by Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION 3:
The coastal hydrography is from older surveys and has been adjusted to revised shoreline. Caution must be exercised while navigating close inshore.

CAUTION 4:
In coral reef areas, depths may be less than indicated.

CAUTION 5:
Lights in Haiti have been reported extinguished or unreliable and buoys are frequently out of position.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.
