CAUTION - ALLIGATOR RIVER - PUNGO RIVER CANAL
Both sides of the canal are foul with debris, snags, submerged stumps, and continuous bank erosion is caused by passing boats and tows. Corps of Engineers controlling dimensions, published in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notices to Mariners, are generally for less than the 27.432 meters /90 foot project width; consequently, navigation near mid-channel is recommended unless otherwise specified in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notices to Marines. Mariners are advised to exercise extreme caution when navigating the canal.
