Due to tidal zoning differences between Muir Inlet and Adams Inlet tide gauges, a possible error may exist in some of the charted soundings in this area. The greatest portion of the error would probably occur in the narrow passages leading to the upper portion of Adams Inlet. The average error recorded is 2.1 meters/7 feet. Use ENC US4AK5TH.
