NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Center List of Lights and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S.Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub 152 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Tuklung Mt, AK 		WNG-525		162.425 MHz
Nome, AK		WXJ-62		162.550 MHz


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional data from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of Data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of Zone of Confidence in Data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html 


WARNING - PROVISIONAL ENC
This ENC was constructed using the best data available. The area of the Yukon River represented with green tint (marsh) was evaluated using satellite imagery of Oct. 24, 2024 to May 26, 2025. The imagery is not coordinated with tides or river stages. (Some sections were compiled at higher river stages, while other sections were compiled at lower river stages.)

Areas identified as shoal that were isolated and separate from the sloping shoreline are represented as blue-tinted obstruction areas. These areas may become uncovered at the lowest river level or may always be submerged.

Areas identified as shoal that were in close proximity to the shoreline have been incorporated into the land and shoreline. The green-tinted land and shoreline is intended to represent the outermost delineation of the sloping land-water interface. Therefore, some sections of shoreline may be covered by water even at the lowest river stage.

All or much of the charted detail near the Yukon River is highly changeable. Navigators should use this ENC with extreme caution.


COLREGS, 80.1705
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS demarcation line.


SHORELINE DATA
All shoreline data in this ENC cell is to be considered 'Approximate'.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
