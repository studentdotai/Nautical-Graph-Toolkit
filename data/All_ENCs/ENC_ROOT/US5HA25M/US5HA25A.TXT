NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii. Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers. 


SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
For Symbols and Abbreviations see Chart no. 1.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL are approximate due to generalization for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL (Quality of data) represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly along the edges. 


SUBMERGED SUBMARINE OPERATIONS
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the waters contained on this chart. Proceed with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Maui, HI            WWG-75      162.400 MHz


COLREGS, 80.1410
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.


ADMINSTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
