Gea Pass, one of the main entrance channels, is used ordinarily by larger ships entering the lagoon.

NOTE 2:
Any vessel transiting within a 20nm radius of Roi-Namur Island, part of Kwajalein Atoll, may experience interference with marine VHF communications, especially VHF International Channel 16. Authorized transiting vessels should stay clear of this area.

NOTE 3:
The Swept Areas in this cell had been swept in 1940 and 1945.

CAUTION 1:
Submerged reefs in this library were collected from commercial imagery and depths may vary from those charted. Mariners are advised to proceed with caution.

CAUTION 2:
Uncharted rocks and coral heads, dangerous to navigation, may exist outside the limits of the swept area.

CAUTION 3:
Pilotage, although not compulsory in this area, is advisable due to uncharted dangers.

CAUTION 4:
Due to the existence of wrecks and cables, vessels are cautioned against anchoring within the atoll without first contacting local authorities.

CAUTION 5:
WARNING AREA - Reagan Test Site: The waters within a circular area with a radius of 200 miles, centered at position 8deg43min N, 167deg43min E, are so designated. Intermittent hazardous missile operations will be conducted within the area 24 hours, on a permanent basis. Normally, operations in the Reagan Test Site are covered by HYDROPAC messages.

CAUTION 6:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.
