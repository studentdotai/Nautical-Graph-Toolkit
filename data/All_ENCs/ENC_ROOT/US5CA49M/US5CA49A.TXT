NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Only marine radiobeacons have been calibrated for surface use.  Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


NOTE B
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted piles, snags, pumps, and pipes, some submerged may exist along the edges of the waterway. Numerous buoys and signs mark the wing dams, along the Sacramento River. Mariners should never attempt to pass between the warning buoys and the shore.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances are charted as furnished by the Corps of Engineers and U.S. Coast Guard. Overhead cable and bridge clearances are referenced to high water. Additionally, within the bounds of this ENC, bridge clearances can also reference Low Water conditions, these conditions are encoded in the INFORM field of the specific bridge.


SACRAMENTO RIVER DEPTHS
Although the soundings depict the general trends in depths, they are unreliable because of continual scouring or shoaling due to changing river stages. The areas which frequently shoal to the extent that passage of vessels drawing over 1.2 meters / 4 feet is difficult at extreme low water stages.

The Federal project provides for a shallow-draft channel, 1.8 meters / 6 feet deep at low water from Sacramento to Colusa.  The Corps of Engineers conducts annual maintenance dredging operations to provide project depth. Consult the District Engineer in Sacramento for controlling depths.


CAUTION
Bridge and cable vertical clearances not subject to tidal influence are referenced to ordinary summer low water level. During flood stage levels, clearances may be reduced by 8.8 meters/29 feet or more.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio Service station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations. 

Sacramento, CA	 KEC-57	 162.55 MHz WX1


POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge 
water within such areas adjacent to domestic water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93).  Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels.
