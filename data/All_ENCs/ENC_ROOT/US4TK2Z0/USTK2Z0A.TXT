CELL ACCURACY:
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some details on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum with the use of 2018 orthorectified imagery.

CAUTION 1:
Many reefs on this chart have been updated through use of Commercial Satellite Imagery. Many areas revealed discolored waters present. Such imagery cannot provide reliable detection of all hazards to navigation. Uncharted hazards may exist.

CAUTION 2:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.
