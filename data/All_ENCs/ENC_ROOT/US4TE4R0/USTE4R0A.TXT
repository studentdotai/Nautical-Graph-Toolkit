POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum with the use of 2019 Ortho-Rectified imagery.

CAUTION 1:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

CAUTION 2:
Most features, including bathymetry, are omitted in this area. The minimal depiction of detail in this area does not support safe navigation. Numerous scattered dangers lie in the lagoon, and in the area between the entrance and the anchorage off Lae Island. These dangers are identifiable under favorable conditions of light.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 126, Sailing Directions, for important supplemental information.
