SURVEY NOTE:
Reconnaissance surveys were conducted in January, 2010 to evaluate earthquake impact on Port-au-Prince harbor. These surveys should be considered preliminary in nature. Surveyed areas may be subject to change as recovery efforts progress. Mariners should contact local authorities for the latest information.

NOTE:
Many areas of Port-au-Prince are under reclamation due to the January 2010 earthquake. These projects are ongoing. Not all areas are marked in this cell. Other areas have extensive land reclamation works and berthing improvements reported (2007). Consult local authorities for additional information.

CAUTION 1:
Due to the earthquake of January, 2010, navaids and landmarks may be unreliable. There may be floating debris, oil spills, and underwater obstructions that may not be shown in this cell. Not all ruins and dangers are marked or known. The mariner must use extreme caution when navigating in the area of this cell.

CAUTION 2:
Detailed information has been omitted or generalized in areas covered by larger scale cell. In such areas only the principal aids to navigation are maintained in this cell by Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION 3 - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.

CAUTION 4:
Lights in Haiti have been reported extinguished or unreliable and buoys are frequently out of position.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 147, Sailing Directions, for important supplemental information.
