NOTES:

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the United States National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the United States Corps of Engineers and United States Coast Guard.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest United States Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult United States Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.  See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency List of Lights and Fog Signals for information not included in the United States Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - LARGER SCALE CHARTS
Danger, Prohibited, and Restricted Areas falling within the limits of the larger scale charts are shown thereon and not repeated.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelinesand submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids tonavigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on manyfloating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE
Recommended traffic lanes established in Prince William Sound are shown on larger scale ENCs.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
