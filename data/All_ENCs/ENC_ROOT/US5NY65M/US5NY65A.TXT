NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.  


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survay, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signal for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearing of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in statute miles between points of departure


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed.  For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SPEED REGULATIONS
SPEED REGULATIONS, See U.S. Rules and Regulations for U.S. waters, 33 CFR Part 401, carried in the Seaway Handbook.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Watertown, NY	WXN-68	162.475 MHz


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
