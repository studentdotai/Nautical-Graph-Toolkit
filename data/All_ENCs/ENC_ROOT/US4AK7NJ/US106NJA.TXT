NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography (From surveys of 1952-53) and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the State of Alaska, the Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - DEPTHS
Depths may vary as much as 1.8 meters (6 feet) due to iceberg groundings.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners


RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons or RACONS are activated by radars operating on the X-Band frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and when activated will emit an international morse code character which will be visible on the radar screen that activated the RACON. The effective range of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 nautical miles. The RACONS will be maintained seasonally from 1 July to 15 September.


SUBSISTENCE WHALING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA
Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15 to October 31.  Vessel operators are requested to contact the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission at (907) 852-2392, or aewcdir@barrow.com prior to entering this area for information about the location and avoidance of traditional Native hunting parties.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/.


CAUTION  USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS) 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Barrow, AK	KZZ-53		162.550 MHz
