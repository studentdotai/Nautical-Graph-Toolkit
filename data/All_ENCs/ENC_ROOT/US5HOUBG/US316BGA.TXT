                                                    4:45 P.M.

*Preceded by announcement on 2182 kHz and 156.8 MHz
Distress calls for small craft are made on 2182 kHz or channel 16 (156.80 MHz) VHF.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels even if small craft have the right-of-way. All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - SURVEY
Stakes, piles and platforms, some submerged, may exist between charted piling and platforms along the maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not shown where they interfere with a light symbol.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms, and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths, and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished, or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

OYSTER AQUACULTURE
Oyster bed aquaculture leases may exist within the limits of this chart. Mariners are cautioned that numerous markers may exist and watermen may be active in the area. Caution should be exercised when navigating in or near these areas, not to anchor or ground, in order to avoid damage to the beds. Depths may be shallower than the soundings shown. Other oyster bed aquaculture leases may exist within the limits of this chart. For more information, contact the local department of natural resources.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary (USCGAUX), and national organizations of boatmen conduct extensive boating instruction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources: USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters 1504 Blue Ridge Rd., Raleigh, NC 27607 888-367-8777; USCGAUX - COMMANDER (OAX), Eighth Coast Guard District, Hale Boggs Federal Building Suite 1126, 500 Poydras Street New Orleans, LA 70130 800-524-8835; or USCG Headquarters, Office of the Chief Director (G-OCX), 2100 Second Street, SW Washington, DC 20593.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system in the Houston, Galveston, and Texas City waterways. Vessel operating procedures and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161; Chapter U.S. Coast Pilot; and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners should consult these sources for applicable rules and reporting requirements. "Houston Traffic" is a full service VTS, providing a continuous Information Service; Traffic Organization Services as requisite; and Navigation Assistance Service upon request.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html .


WEATHER RULES FOR SAFE BOATING
Before setting out:
1. Check local weather and sea conditions.
2. Obtain the latest weather forecast for your area from radio broadcasts.

When warnings are in effect, don't go out unless you are confident your boat can be navigated safely under forecast conditions of wind and sea.

While afloat:
1. Keep a weather eye out for:
    A. A sudden vertical cumulus cloud development
    B. A sudden change in wind direction
    C. A sudden noticeable increase in wind velocity
    D. A drop in temperature
2. Be alert to heavy static on your AM radio which may indicate approaching thunderstorms
3. Check radio weather broadcasts for latest forecasts and warnings

Thunder squalls often occur on warm, moist afternoons and are a great hazard to the mariner. They can have wind gusts up to 80 mph and hit almost without warning. To survive a squall, you must prevent being capsized or blown to leeward into danger.
