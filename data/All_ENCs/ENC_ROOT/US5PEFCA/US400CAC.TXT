SECURITY ZONE
33 CFR 165.760 Vessels may be allowed to transit the Intracoastal Waterway when passenger vessels or vessels carrying cargoes of particular hazard are berthed, by staying east of the law enforcement vessels and cruise ship tenders, which will mark a transit lane in the Intracoastal Waterway. Periodically, vessels may be required to temporarily hold their positions while large commercial traffic operates in this area. Vessels in this security zone must follow the orders of the COTP or his designated representative, who may be embarked in law enforcement or other vessels on scene. When passenger vessels are not berthed on the Intracoastal Waterway, navigation will be unrestricted. Law enforcement vessels can be contacted on VHF Marine Band Radio Channel 16 (156.8 MHz).
