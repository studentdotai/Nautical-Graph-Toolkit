CAUTION - SHOALING
The zero meter curve in Chilkat Inlet at the mouth of the Chilkat River is shown as surveyed in 1998. Significant amounts of sediment are being deposited in this area by the river, resulting in the advance of the zero meter curve an average of 22.9 meters/75 feet per year (based on the position change from 1890 to 1998).
