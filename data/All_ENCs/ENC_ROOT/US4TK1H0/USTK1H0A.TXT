NOTE:
The original soundings were in fathoms.

CELL ACCURACY:
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some details on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION:
The aids to navigation on this chart are reported to be unreliable. They may be missing, unlit, or out of position.

POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum with the use of 2017-2018 orthorectified imagery.

CAUTION 1:
Many reefs on this chart have been updated through use of Commercial Satellite Imagery. Such imagery cannot provide reliable detection of all hazards to navigation. Uncharted hazards may exist. Many of which are unmarked. The hydrographic and topographic details shown on this chart are subject to constant change and may not always be reliable.

CAUTION 2:
Uncharted and undetected rocks and coral heads, dangerous to navigation, may exist outside the limits of the swept area.

CAUTION 3:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 126, Sailing Directions, for important supplemental information.
