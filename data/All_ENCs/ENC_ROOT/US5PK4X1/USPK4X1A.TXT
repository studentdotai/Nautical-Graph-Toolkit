POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum through the use of a Rectified Ortho-photo.

LIDAR SURVEYS:
Areas of this chart have been surveyed with the airborne CHARTS LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system. LIDAR is an accepted method of rapid hydrographic survey of coastal areas which meets International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards for accuracy, quality and hazard detection. LIDAR, which has a maximum seabed detection limit of approximately 40 meters is affected by environmental factors such as water clarity (turbidity), sea state and sun angle. Such environmental factors present at the time of data collection may limit the range or geographic extents of soundings gathered by the system. In such cases, LIDAR data may have been augmented by other sources in the construction of this chart.

CAUTION 1:
Due to the earthquake of January 2010, aids to navigation and landmarks may be unreliable. There may be floating debris, oil spills, and underwater obstructions that may not be shown in this chart. Not all ruins and dangers are marked or known. The navigator should use extreme caution when navigating in the area of this chart.

CAUTION 2 - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.3

CAUTION 3:
Lights in Haiti have been reported extinguished or unreliable and buoys are frequently out of position.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 147, Sailing Directions, for important supplemental information.
