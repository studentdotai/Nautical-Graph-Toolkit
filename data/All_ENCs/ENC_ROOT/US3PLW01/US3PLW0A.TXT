CELL ACCURACY:
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some details on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

POSITIONING:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum through the use of commercial satellite imagery.

SOUNDING DATUM:
Reduced to the approximate level of Mean Low Water Springs minus 0.3 meters.

CAUTION 1:
This chart is intended for offshore navigation only. In areas covered by larger scale charts, only the principal aids to navigation are maintained by Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION 2:
QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA - The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of Data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of Zone of Confidence in Data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.

CAUTION 3:
Many reefs on this chart have been updated through use of Commercial Satellite Imagery. Such imagery cannot provide reliable detection of all hazards to navigation. Uncharted hazards may exist.

CAUTION 4:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.

TIDAL INFORMATION:
Refer to Admiralty Total Tides Program for the latest information.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Pub. 126, Sailing Directions, for important supplemental information.
