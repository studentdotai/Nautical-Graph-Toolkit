NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in New York, NY. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. Numerous lights, lighted and unlighted buoys, and daybeacons in Hempstead Bay are privately maintained seasonally. Consult the U.S. Coast Guard Light List for additional information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802(toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

CITY		STATION		FREQUENCY	BROADCAST TIMES
New York, NY	KWO-35		162.550 MHz	24 hours daily
New London, CT	KHB-47		162.550 MHz	24 hours daily
Meriden, CT	WXJ-42		162.400 MHz	24 hours daily
Riverhead, NY	WXM-80		162.475 MHz	24 hours daily


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small craft warnings will be displayed from sunrise to sunset on Suffolk County Marine Police Patrol Boats while underway in the coastal and navigable inland waters of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. 


CAUTION - ALL CRAFT
All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft operators are warned to beware of severe water turbulence caused by large vessels traversing narrow waterways.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadron and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information regarding these educational courses contact the following sources: USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, Post Office Box 30423, Raleigh, North Carolina 27612, 919-821-0281. USCGAUX - 1st Coast Guard District, 408 Atlantic Ave., Boston, MA 02110-2209. Tel. 617-223-8310 or USCG Headquarters (G-BAU), Washington, D.C.20593-0001.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that channel. A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should pass port to port. When motorboats approach each other at right angles or obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most cases. Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when safe and practicable. Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication "Amalgamated International & U.S. Inland Navigation Rules."


ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The National Ocean Service acknowledges the exceptional cooperation received from members of the Jones Beach Power Squadron, District 3, United States Power Squadrons, in continually providing essential information for revising this chart.

FORECASTING HINTS
With present communications, forecast facilities and storm advisories, the skilled mariner does not stand helpless before the elements. In addition to these aids, marine weather lore has been passed down for many years. Masters of ships as well as mates who assume bridge watches should have a good understanding of the significance of wind and barometer changes. In addition small boat operators, not equipped with adequate communications, must resort to local weather indications. They should have an understanding of the significance of local wind shifts and barometric tendencies as signs of changing weather. Low pressure areas are generally associated with bad weather and high pressure areas with fair weather. As a common rule, winds from easterly quadrants and falling barometer, foretell the coming of foul weather; and shifting winds to westerly quadrants foretell clearing and fair weather.


WEATHER RULES FOR SAFE BOATING
Before setting out:
1. Check local weather and sea conditions.
2. Obtain the latest weather forecast for your area from radio broadcasts. When warnings are in effect, don't go out unless you are confident your boat can be navigated safely under forecast conditions of wind and sea.
While afloat:
1. Keep a weather eye out for:
   A. A sudden vertical cumulus cloud development.
   B. A sudden change in wind direction.
   C. A sudden noticeable increase in wind velocity.
   D. A drop in temperature.
2. Be alert to heavy static on your AM radio which may indicate approaching thunderstorms.
3. Check radio weather broadcasts for latest forecasts and warnings.
Thunder squalls often occur on warm, moist afternoons and are a great hazard to the mariner. They can have wind gusts up to 128.7 kph / 80 mph and hit almost without warning. To survive a squall, you must prevent being capsized or blown to leeward into danger.


ROUTES
The main and secondary routes are marked by additional beacons and buoys maintained during the summer months by state and private interests.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.
