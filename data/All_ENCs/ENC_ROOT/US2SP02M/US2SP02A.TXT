NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
For complete list of Symbols and Abbreviations, see Chart No. 1.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography from Japanese, U.S. Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency surveys.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids.
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error
and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist
within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried
may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating
vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


HORIZONTAL DATUM
The horizontal reference datum for this chart is unknown, except for areas with larger scale
chart coverage. The horizontal reference datum for all areas covered by larger scale charts
can be considered equivalent to World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84), which for charting
purposes is also considered equivalent to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).
The charted features on larger scale charts were shifted by means of geo-referenced satellite
imagery and geo-referenced aerial photography, and have not been confirmed by land-based
geodetic methods.


CURRENTS
For details on ocean currents in this area, see Admiralty Sailing Directions and Routeing Charts.


PIRACY WARNINGS
Piracy warnings are transmitted daily by the Piracy Reporting Centre (PRC) at Kuala Lumpur, through Enhanced Group Calling (EGC) using the Inmarsat SafetyNET System. For further details, see Admiralty List of Radio Signals.


CELL ACCURACY
Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some detail on this cell may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.
