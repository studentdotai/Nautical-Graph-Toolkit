NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8 and 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 8 and 9 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological Survey, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and Canadian Hydrographic Service.


CAUTION - HYDROGRAPHIC
Hydrographic details and aids to navigation are not generally shown where larger scale coverage is available.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are urged to use caution when navigating in the area of this chart. Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have occurred as a result of the earthquake of March 27, 1964. The magnitude of change is known only at selected sites which are indicated by note on the larger scale charts.


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of Data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of Zone of Confidence in Data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


COLREGS, 80.1705
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions of Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


MARITIME BOUNDARY
Any international maritime boundary shown in the disputed area is without prejudice to the legal position of the United States or Canada.


RACONS
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS, are activated by radars operating on the X-Band, frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and, when activated will emit an international Morse code character which will be visible on the radar screen that activated the RACON. The effective range of the RACONS will be 8 miles.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
