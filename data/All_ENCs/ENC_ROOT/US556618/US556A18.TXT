VEGETATION:
Almost all of these islands are covered in dense trees on the entirety of the island. (Palm trees)

FISH AGGREGATION DEVICES:
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), anchored or drifting, are commonly deployed within the waters of many Pacific Islands and may not be charted. Even though many of the installations are temporary in nature, FADs pose significant risk to navigation safety. Prudent mariners should exercise caution in navigating these waters.
