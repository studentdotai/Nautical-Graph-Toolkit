NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


CAUTION - FISHING STRUCTURES
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - GAS PIPELINES AND WELLS
Gas pipelines and wells contain natural gas under pressure and damage to these installations would create an immediate fire hazard. Vessels anchoring in Lake Erie should do so with caution after noting the underwater, and therefore concealed, positions of all oil and gas wells, pipelines submerged cables and other installations.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels. For more information visit https://navigation.usace.army/mil/Survey/Hydro/


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


CAUTION - DRILLING TOWERS
Mariners are advised that oil and gas drilling towers are temporarily established in various parts of Lake Erie. These towers exhibit a Quick Flashing White Light and each is equipped with an automatic fog signal sounding one blast of 2 seconds duration followed by 18 seconds of silence.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Erie, PA	 KEC-58        162.400 MHz
Buffalo, NY      KEB-98        162.550 MHz


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html .


PLANE OF REFERENCE OF THIS CHART
Plane of Reference of this chart (Low Water Datum) 173.49 m/569.2 ft. Referred to mean water level at Rimouski, Quebec, International Great Lakes Datum (1985).
