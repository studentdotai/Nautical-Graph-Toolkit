WOODS HOLE PASSAGE
In the narrow part of Woods Hole Passage (Woods Hole, 160.9 metres / 0.1 mile SW of Devils Foot Island) the current velocity at times exceeds 4.5 knots. Velocities as high as 5.0 knots have been reported by the U.S. Coast Guard. During periods of high currents, aids in Woods Hole Pass and Broadway may appear to be sinking or riding low. For daily predictions of the current, the Tidal Current Tables, Atlantic Coast should be consulted.
