NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


PUGET SOUND HARBOR SAFETY PLAN
The US Coast Guard and the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee have developed and adopted a Harbor Safety Plan that formally established a set of Standards of Care for Puget Sound and surrounding waters. These Standards of Care are intended to supplement existing regulations by documenting good marine practices for a variety of operations including tug escorts, pilotage, anchoring, lightering, and provides additional information on required charts, Aids to Navigation and Emergency Response. If your vessel does not already have a copy of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Plan, visit https://marexps.com/membership/puget-sound-harbor-safety-committee/ or contact the Marine Exchange of Puget Sound at (206) 443-3830.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Canadian Surveys and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 10 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Neah Bay, WA		KIH-36		162.550 MHz
Puget Sound, WA		WWG-24		162.425 MHz
Seattle, WA.		KHB-60		162.550 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


COLREGS, 80.1385 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SMALL ARMS SAFETY ZONE
Naval Air Station small arms range operates 7 days a week. Red flashing light and flags are displayed during live fire exercises. Use caution when transiting near the zone.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE H
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system has been established by the United States and Canada within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region. The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Prince Rupert Traffic, Seattle Traffic, and Victoria Traffic) administers the rules issued by both nations; however, it will enforce only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction.


NOTE B
Naval vessels may be maneuvering in circles in this area. Proceed with caution. For further information consult Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners.
