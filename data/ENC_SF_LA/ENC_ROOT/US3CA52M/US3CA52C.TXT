IMO AMENDED TRAFFIC SEPARETION SCHEME
Portions of the traffic separation scheme shown on this ENC have been amended by the IMO. See IMO COLREG.2/Circ.64. Please be advised that these portions have been revised by the United States Coast Guard and that the corresponding changes have not been updated in the Code of Federal Regulations(33 CFR part 167). There are differences between the two traffic separation schemes and caution is advised.


TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
One-way traffic lanes are recommended for use by all vessels traveling between the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to San Francisco Bay but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. Separation Zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to be free of ship traffic. Separation Zones should not be used except for crossing purposes. Mariners are requested to stay outside the circular separation zone centered on the San Francisco Approach Lighted Horn Buoy SF. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution.

The U.S. Coast Guard operates an Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System (OVMRS) covering the seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay. All commercial vessels over 300 gross tons and all tugs with tows are requested to contact Vessel Traffic Service San Francisco on VHF-FM channel 12 (156.60 MHz) when entering this area. All vessels in the area are encouraged to listen on channel 12 at fifteen and forty-five minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known shipping traffic in the area. Additional information on the OVMRS is published in Coast Pilot 10 and information concerning specific operating procedures in available from the VTS.
