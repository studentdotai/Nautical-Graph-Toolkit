NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Long Beach, California, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


POLLUTION REPORTS  
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Center List of Lights and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.
 
 
CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys. 


CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of data) are approximate due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES  
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral development structures shown, subject to approval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


VESSELS TRANSITING 
The U.S. Coast Guard and Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.


NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES AND MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
National Marine Sanctuaries are protected areas, administered by NOAA, which contain sensitive and diverse natural and cultural resources. These areas are particularly sensitive to environmental damage such as spills of oil and other hazardous materials, discharges and groundings. Exercise particular caution and follow applicable Sanctuary regulations when transiting these areas. A full description of Sanctuary regulations may be found in 15 CFR 922 and in the U.S. Coast Pilot. A full description of the federal regulations governing the Marine Protected Areas located within Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries may be found in 15 CFR 922 and 50 CFR 660. A full description of the state regulations governing the Marine Protected Areas located within Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries may be found in Title 14 California Code of Regulations (CCR) section 632.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, AND TIDES
Real-time water levels, tide predictions, and tidal current predictions are available on the internet from NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/water_level_info.html and https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/currents_info.html.
